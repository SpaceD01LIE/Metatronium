Scalable Cubic Manufacturing System Comprising Continuous Cellular Reinforced Gusset Chambers:

METATRONIUM: 

noun [ U ] ~  met̬.əˈ.troʊ.ni.əm

Metatronium is the blanket term for a metamaterial system transcendent of natural material, 
enabling new and innovative applications well beyond our current paradigm of composite systems.

1. Meta: A prefix meaning "beyond" or "transcending." In this project, the term "metamaterial" is
    used to describe a material that has properties beyond those found naturally.
   These properties are achieved by designing the material's structure at an addressable sub-composition level.
   
2. Tron: Referencing particle energy and alluding to the digital realm.
   The project uses digital manufacturing techniques to create physical structures with a high degree of accuracy.
   
3. -ium: the suffix is used in chemistry to denote a chemical element.
   In this project, the suffix "-ium" denotes a new material created using metamaterial fabrication technology. 

The Metatronium system offers numerous benefits that grow with each new iteration of machine design. 
As new combinations of materials are introduced, their basic properties combine to create a broader 
spectrum of end product attributes. This allows for highly specialized features and remarkable overall results.

One of the key advantages of the Metatronium system is its ability to adapt the density of specific
regions within the products. By adjusting the gauge of material set versus the overall span of the gusset chambers, 
the density can be tailored to meet the specific needs of a design. 
This results in a finished product that surpasses the expectations of modern composite
material hybridization, with density ratios ranging from 0.02 up to 0.2.

Another significant benefit of the Metatronium system is the adaptation of the scalar nature of the lattice.
By doing so, the overall processing requirements for a cubic volume can be reduced by a factor of 1/8 the
steps needed for a smaller scale lattice node. This reduction in steps leads to a substantial increase
in throughput for finished products, as it lowers the total number of functions involved in printing the parts.

The Metatronium system can also apply this principle in reverse, enabling the placement of a denser latticework
around the perimeter of a product. This refines the overall resolution of a part's finished geometry, 
allowing for even greater precision and detail. Furthermore, the chambers at the perimeter can be filled with
aggregate materials to provide a backing substrate for mechanical fastening and to solidify the external surfaces.
The Metatronium system's unique capabilities can bring about transformative changes in various industries, 
significantly impacting the state of the art in manufacturing. 
Here's a more detailed look at how this technology could revolutionize different sectors:

1.	Aerospace:
   The aerospace industry is constantly seeking lighter and stronger materials to improve fuel efficiency,
  	reduce emissions, and enhance performance. Metatronium materials can be tailored to achieve specific

  	 or pollution control. Additionally, the customizable lattice structures could be employed to
  	create materials with enhanced adsorption or catalytic properties,
  	aiding in waste management and resource recovery.
  	
The Metatronium system's ability to utilize otherwise wasted raw materials is yet another significant
advantage, particularly in terms of sustainability and cost-effectiveness. 
By incorporating materials such as fiberglass and recycled plastics like polypropylene or high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE), the system enables the inexpensive processing and repurposing of vast amounts of waste material.

The Metatronium structure, when constructed with a 200mm base measurement, results in a form factor
that is close in weight to styrofoam but offers superior strength and durability. This is achieved by
manufacturing the material from two sheets of HDPE with a 45g/m fiberglass fabric fused between them 
under thermal extrusion, resulting in a finished material that is just 0.6mm thick.
The finished substrate comprises a solid volume five layers thick, containing 625 hermetically
sealed pockets of air, and results in an overall weight of 21kg per cubic meter.

This innovative structural composition opens up new opportunities for the creation of massive, 
continuous substrates that can be used as stable structural foundations in marine environments. 
The ability to construct artificial land will become increasingly important as we seek to
supplement the available real estate for various purposes, such as agriculture and industrial facilities.

The Metatronium system's potential to revolutionize land reclamation and marine construction projects is immense.
By using recycled materials and offering a lightweight, durable, and cost-effective alternative to 
traditional construction materials, the system can contribute to more sustainable and environmentally 
friendly development practices. This could have significant implications for coastal communities, 
island nations, and other areas where land scarcity is a pressing concern.

In summary, the Metatronium system's ability to utilize otherwise wasted raw materials not
only offers a more sustainable and cost-effective approach to manufacturing but also presents new opportunities 
for large-scale marine construction projects and land reclamation efforts. By addressing the challenges of
land scarcity and promoting environmentally friendly development practices, the Metatronium system has the
potential to drive significant change in various industries and contribute to a more sustainable future.
