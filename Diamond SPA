DIAMOND Dedicated Inalienable Attributive Metatronium Ordinal Navigation Database
MISSION: 
To elevate digital manufacturing by rewarding collaboration. 
VISION:
By connecting creators and ideas across a network of partnerships and ensuring fair compensation, 
the system aims to streamline the design-to-production process and incentivize innovation.
FUNCTION:
Diamond will exist as a portal to interface the collective works of this system by streamlining
the logistics and providing contractual brokerage services.
Key Features:

1)  Universal Iterated Attribution Rights: {Golden Rule} =φ:  
Every design level is attributed to its creator(s). If someone else uses or builds upon that design,
the original creator(s) get rewarded with an iterative attribution
following the golden ratio (φ = 1.61803399)
Total cost is calculated against φ
If a production has a cost of 100: then 100= φ
The total charged will then cost 161.8 with the 61.8 being distributed following iterations of: φ/ᵠ

61.8% of tendered contract is remitted to the production line expenses.
{(material, energy, transportation, labour, administrative) all local taxes accounted for under this umbrella}
Onestone will retain the first distributive attribution φ. This works out to 23.6% from every tendered contract.
The remaining 14.59 % will be distributed to the creators of the sub techs following the same formula φ/ᵠ
Each level added will drop the attribution level by the same golden ratio:}1/.61804
summarized:  production=61.8%, Onestone=23%, sub layer iteration> 9%, 3.4%, 2.1%, ex. 

2) Every contract tendered will be recorded on Blockchain.
In addition, every contribution to the system topology will be inscribed in the blockchain, 
securing the right to attribution.
This attribution is intended to incentivise development.

3.	Partnership Model: Everyone involved with Diamond is considered a partner. 
This partnership grants access to the platform and its benefits.

Concept Overview:

Diamond will be the portal application used for access to the platform.
The UI will be designed and modeled as an educational platform that showcases examples of trending contracts 
and teaches people how to run their own concepts to be processed and estimated.
It's design interface may resemble a VR MMO video game like Minecraft.
When users are in the construction area they will be able to search available items or
models, and if they get to the end of their search without finding what they're looking 
for, they will have the option to design and develop that item themselves; resulting in attribution right for that library item.
If an item has been designed and the AI in the interface is capable of modeling it,
there may be additional steps involved until such time as the intended functions have been built into the 
production line such as specific materials or componentry. 
Initially the system will be limited by the capabilities opened up for production. 
The first scale of Metatronium introduced will be 100mm/node.

Long term the vision for Diamond is a digital interface that:

1.	Provides tools and training for users to design and create.

2.	Allows users to search for and incorporate virtual materials and parts into their designs.

3.	Operates on a principle of universal attribution and equity dispersal,
ensuring developers contribution/ attribution rights.
4.	Remunerative Dilution: This is a system where the φ/ᵠ ratio of compensation for a design 
decrease as more and more designs build upon it. 
The idea is the earliest designs get a smaller piece of the pie as more layers are added on top.
5.	Production and Manufacturing: The system also handles the production side. 
Producers are alerted to new designs, and there's a clear system for calculating costs and profits.

the Intentions for the organizational body 
that will be used to manage the logistical operation of Metatronium establishes
the system as a public utility and into public domain where the free market 
operates following the protocol established when setting forth of the exchange. 
I see incentivized inclusion on a global community level as the path forward. 
Onestone comportments' emulate the principles of thermodynamics:
universal principality. 

Working towards a bridging solution that will not Challenge the basis of our Current 
economic paradigm, or challenge the statutes governing agreed upon parameters 
within any national economic environment.
Can be pictured as the following of custom inherent to any national region.

Pedestrian example:

You are a guest visiting another's home: you operate with manners and integrity.
We will make every attempt and responsible process a standard for operational principles engaging within that system. 

Space population alpha is not a national entity and therefore imposes no authority within any set nation.

Everything on the Diamond network is 100% open source. 

Establishing Onestone as a business-friendly nongovernmental organization is the Alpha.
The consideration of universal principality equates to Circular inclusivity. 
A Circular economy, and closed loop system draws roots philisophically 
from The Lakota: Sacred hoop. 
The sacred hoop is everything related to Our grandmother Earth, 
Every aspect of spirit existing within the sacred hoop is all related and is all sacred.
Universality is universal love. 
Use of the word sacred is important in context to this framework.

SPA= Space Population Alpha

Onestone's First principal is honouring the life givers.  
Onestone is established under a mandate philosophy that 
encompasses reverence for the land, the forests, the oceans, the animals,
the insects, the people, and the interconnectedness of all life. 

Vision of establishing a unified network of material processing hubs 
located waste management operations are required: at every village, town, or city. 
Operating a public utility able to manufacture a Universal calibration lattice under 
partnership with the Diamond network that issues tenders on requested product contracts.
The distribution of profit, or the service payment, standards, associated 
to any contract: will have absolute transparency. 

What makes it fun is: being able to build the technology at basement 100 and opens 
up the possibility of creating very inexpensive utility substrate that can be easily adapted
to replace any level of construction infrastructure that Doesn't overlap the nodal geometry.

My personal mission will be manufacturing the Printer tech, 
and producing them fit in a standard, 20 foot shipping container, or seacan. 
Depending on where they are headed, more remote locations Might need up to three shipping container types: 
One Printer, second would be the power hub,  
Last One would be the material processing unit

Building the material at 100 basement can create a finished structure or substrate that weighs about 4% of the weight of water,
where a cubic meter consists of 5000 hermetically sealed pockets of air.
Basement 200 is the right size to make massive floating foundation structure.

{Notes}



With most manufacturing businesses: scaling up production can be a real challenge.
If you were to ask most of them why? they'd tell you land is Expensive. 
As soon as any functional model of manufacturing tech has been built: we're intending to open source that
To allow anybody else to follow our plans to build it; along with pumping out 
those systems from our facility: 

The core development team will be building the next basement level in perpetuity, 
along with the integration systemization that will enable form and function to re iterate the process. 

At which point we start to ship.
We open source it. 
We allow anybody else to build it with open source license that requires attributive continuity.
Keeping the record of manufacture on the diamond system.
the diamond system will be free for anyone to access. 
It will be free for anyone to play with, and it will be free for anyone to design.
Create. 
and utilize. 
if for nothing more than to build themselves what they would like to make 
out of what the system can produce.
And again: that development will hold an  attributive value that will be
associated to that creator; and available through the diamond exchange to
anyone else Capable of interfacing this system..
What this will do is incentivize developers to jump on and race each other to the utility. 
Now this would fuck everything up if the attribution and distribution that
was calculated into every contract tendered did not follow a specific I think the word is logarithmic distributive ratio:
so that will be the golden rule.
Every time anyone adds something to it, it is the top level. 
So while your shit is at the top level you'll be getting paid every time somebody uses it, But when people add other things to it,
and other people want that other thing that's added to it included in their piece, 

the distributive protocol will be applied: 

top level is now the second level.
Then.
the 3rd 
then the 4th 
then the 5th 
and that logarithmic cost formula will ensure that the game is still fresh for anyone who gets onto it.

That distributed attribution honoring their contribution to the system will deflate relative to the overall configuration.
Therefore reducing their reward; and providing a base for the next developers opportunity To ride that wave.

The way that that formula breaks down is following phi. 

The Golden Rule

The equation formed from every expense going up the line. 
from raw material, processing, distribution, utilities, overheads,
delivery drivers;
like everybody's paid out of that for what it will actually cost to get that tendered contract delivered. 
and the container price for the unit as offered through this exchange 
Will have that 61.8% for distributive attribution honoring.

{IMPORTANT NOTE}

In that. Onestone: which will be set up as a non governmental organization, 
will be receiving 23.6% on every contract tendered across the board.
outside of production cost and distributive expenses for everything 
at the one and lower level of contract tendered value transfer.
and the remaining profit.

So if your tech is at the top of the design repository tendered to contract

from total price paid: you will receive roughly 9% 

And that number rolls down into the Fibonacci spiral of attribution for every step added to future tendered contracts.
So again, in the initial stages of this development, it will not make a shit ton of sense to too many people.
But those who do understand what it is, and put the effort into development of functional added utility. 
There will be a residual attribution carried with that effort following this pattern into perpetuity..


Part of what makes this a beautiful thing to do in setting up 

ONESTONE AS A NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION

is that 

ONESTONE CANT KEEP THE MONEY IT EARNS

It will be mandated within the charter of operations that money will need to find an outlet.
